# Dungeon_Grind

The goal behind this little project is to learn the language C++ and use new learned things like classes, functions and more right away in my project. 
Also trying out new things like Github and OpenAI.

Dungeon Grind should be done in autuumn 2024 as a text based game. But won't promise anything.
There is still much to learn and to do.
